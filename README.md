Skeleton Application
===========================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, skeleton application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to begin a new ZF2 project.

This skeleton application can be used for developing new independent, composable
Modules or it can be used to create a skeleton for a Site. It works for both!

For instance, at its base, this code is for the "application skeleton" site, note
how it Composes in the `Cornerstone` module. Yet, when you go look at that module
it isn't too much different. What's nice about this set up is that you can have
files in the 'public' directory of your module to help you test its MVC flows
_In Isolation_ from your actual site to make sure they're actually composable!

Requirements
------------
As noted in the composer file, this module requires `zendframework/zendframework` 2.2 or higher as well as `oakensoul/Cornerstone`.

Installation with Composer
--------------------------
The initial creation of a project should be done by performing a clone using composer; make sure to answer "Yes" when it prompts `Do you want to remove the existing VCS (.git, .svn..) history?`.
```
composer create-project -sdev --repository-url="https://github.com/" oakensoul/application-skeleton replace/with/path/to/install
```

Generate a Configuration File
------------------------------------------
Create a config file in config/autoload/<environment>.json. Use the example_environment.json.dist file as a base if needed.

Generate Your Virtual Host
--------------------------
To generate a virtual host you need to run the packaged cli script. Note, this depends on the oakensoul/Cornerstone module to run.
```
./cornerstone.php vhost build --env=<environment>
```

Update the `module` Folder
--------------------------
If you are creating a new module using this Application skeleton, simply rename the ApplicationSkeleton folder to match the
name of your new module. Note, you will need to update various references to it throughout the code.

```
$ cd module/
$ mv ApplicationSkeleton NewModuleName
```

Namespace Updates for `Module.php` and `IndexController.php`
```
namespace ApplicationSkeleton;
```

becomes

```
namespace NewModuleName;
```

Update Configuration Files
--------------------------
### config/application.config.php

Update the `$modules` array and change `Application` to your module name (e.g., NewModuleName).
```
$modules = array (
    'Cornerstone',
    'ApplicationSkeleton'
);
$application_config['modules'] = $modules;
```

becomes

```
$modules = array (
    'Cornerstone',
    'NewModuleName'
);
$application_config['modules'] = $modules;
```

### config/autoload/global.php
Change the value of the `Region` key to match your module slug
Change the value of the `Domain` key to match your domain

For example, when I test any of my modules I tend to set them up as:
  http://module-name.oakensoul.com/

```
return array (
    'Installation' => array (
        'Vhost' => array (
            'Server' => array (
                'Domain' => 'oakensoul',
                'Region' => 'skeleton-application.'
            )
        )
    )
);
```

becomes

```
return array (
    'Installation' => array (
        'Vhost' => array (
            'Server' => array (
                'Domain' => 'oakensoul',
                'Region' => 'module-name.'
            )
        )
    )
);
```

Or, update it to match your new sites region and domain:
```
return array (
    'Installation' => array (
        'Vhost' => array (
            'Server' => array (
                'Domain' => 'oakensoul',
                'Region' => 'www.'
            )
        )
    )
);
```

### module/<module name>/config/module.config.php
#### Add routes

Add any routes you would like as necessary.

#### Update Invokables
```
$controllers = array (
    'invokables' => array (
        'Application\Controller\Index' => 'ApplicationSkeleton\Controller\IndexController'
    )
);
```

becomes

```
$controllers = array (
    'invokables' => array (
        'Application\Controller\Index' => 'NewModuleName\Controller\IndexController'
    )
);
```

Note: In the above example, we are overloading the home route (Application\Controller\Index). Likely you won't
wnat to do that unless you're creating an actual site / new homepage. If you're working with a module, typically
you would create entirely new routes.

Add additional invokables as necessary.

#### Update Views (If Needed)
You typically will not need to update the view data. If necessary, you would place your changes in this block:
```
$view_manager = array (
    'template_path_stack' => array (
        __DIR__ . '/../view'
    )
);
```

Update/Create Automated Tests
-----------------------------
All PHPUnit based tests are located under the `test/phpunit` directory with CasperJS tests
located under the `test/caspserjs` directory. Update or create tests as you develop your module.

Documentation
-------------
Please update your module documentation, everyone loves great documentation!
