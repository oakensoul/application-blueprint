{"name":"cornerstone-vagrant","description":"Installs/Configures a cornerstone based application in a vagrant environment","long_description":"Cornerstone Vagrant\n=============\n\nCookbook for deploying Cornerstone based ZF2 applications to vagrant VMs. This cookbook layers a Cornerstone application and several helpful\ndeveloper tools on top of the php-webserver cookbook.\n\nCookbooks\n---------\n\n* [web-developer-cookbook](https://github.com/turbine-web/web-developer-cookbook)\n* [php-webserver](https://github.com/turbine-web/php-webserver)\n* [platform_packages](https://github.com/fnichol/chef-platform_packages)\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n* `node['cornerstone-vagrant']['project']` - The project name ex. 'cornerstone'\n* `node['cornerstone-vagrant']['environment']` - Application environment, ex. 'vagrant'\n* `node['cornerstone-vagrant']['siteslug']` - The hostname that comes before '.com' usually the same as the `project`\n* `node['cornerstone-vagrant']['www-user-group-name']` - The apache user group name\n* `node['cornerstone-vagrant']['known-host']` - A host that should be added to the known_hosts file before composer is run\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n## cornerstone-vagrant:default\n\nThe default recipe should be used to setup a Cornerstone based ZF2 application on a vagrant virtual machine. First it creates a\nphp webserver virtual machine via the [php-webserver](https://github.com/turbine-web/php-webserver) cookbook and then it\nadds a variety of helpful tools to the server.\n\nThe first set of tools is installed by the [web-developer-cookbook](https://github.com/turbine-web/web-developer-cookbook)\nwhich installs the following by default:\n\n* `git`\n* `nodejs`\n* `grunt`\n* `ruby`\n* `casperjs`\n\nThe second set of tools is installed by the [platform_packages](https://github.com/fnichol/chef-platform_packages) cookbook.\nwhich installs the following tools by default:\n\n* `vim`\n* `dos2unix`\n* `wireshark`\n* `tshark`\n\nFinally the recipe assumes the application code is available at /vagrant it will `cd` there and execute the following tasks:\n\n* Add a configurable git server to the ssh known hosts (optional)\n* `composer install` - downloads application's dependencies\n* `application initialize` - generates the vhost\n* `a2ensite` - enables the vhost\n* `apache2 restart` - restarts apache.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThis cookbook will composer install, initialize the application, create the vhost, enable the site, and restart apache.\nTo use it simply add `cornerstone-vagrant` to your vagrant file's run list and your Berksfile.\n\nLicense\n------------------\n\nCopyright:: 2014 web-masons Contributors\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the 'License');\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an 'AS IS' BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n1.
