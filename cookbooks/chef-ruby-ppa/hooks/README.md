This is a management-system for `git`'s shell-script hooks, based on [this Stack Overflow
response][so], and [these subsequent scripts][dotfiles] by [Henrik Nyh][].

This system was cloned from [ELLIOTTCABLE].

Install the hooks by running `./install-git-hooks`. (Any
hooks of your own will remain functional, but be moved to another name.)
