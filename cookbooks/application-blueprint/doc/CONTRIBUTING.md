# Contributing
So, you want to contribute to the Cornerstone project? Welcome! This project is
used for a number of applications, so please read through the following
documentation to get acquainted with the project.

## The Vision
Before you can contribute to the project, it's best to understand what the project
is trying to accomplish and what it is not.

For those of us who love to write software, we often will start from a common
collection of code modules. For those of you reading this, that is likely the ZF2
Framework. If you have worked with ZF2 at all, you will know that there is already
a great skeleton application provided by the ZF2 community. That skeleton application
comes with a full set of files to start your own site. However, it is sparse
and allows you to derive your own implementation (and rightfully so!).
It gives you everything you need to pave your own way.

Cornerstone (and its partner [skeleton-application](https://github.com/oakensoul/application-skeleton)
is a replacement (or feature extension really) for community skeleton-app.
It provides a few pre-paved roads for you to build on because it's not meant for
everyone out there, just the folks that like what it does and want to use it.

The primary drive for Cornerstone is to provide a more formal implementation and
collection of systems for beginning new site or module development. You will notice
that Cornerstone itself is both a ZF2 Module and also a site in its own right. When used
as a Module, only the module pieces will be engaged, but when developing the module itself
you have the full MVC at your fingertips so you can develop and test in relative isolation.

Cornerstone is meant to provide additional utilitarian features and functionality,
most of which should be configurable so that you can choose what features you wish
to take advantage of.

The project is attempting to walk a fine line between making a lot of best practices
easier for you while not telling you what to do and how to do it. If it's not your
cup of tea, no hard feelings! Though feedback and constructive criticism is always
welcome!

## The Basics
This project uses the "GitHub" branching model. If you'd like to read more on
some of the various branching models, the two big Elephpants in the room are
the [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) and the
[Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.

## Running Tests
The most important part of changes are their tests. Every new feature or issue
being fixed should have a matching test. This project uses PHPUnit, CasperJS
and Phantom.

### PHPUnit Tests
* Make sure you have PHPUnit installed with an updated version
* PHPUnit tests will be located in `test/phpunit/`

### CasperJS Tests
* Make sure you have CasperJS and Phantom installed with updated versions
* CasperJS tests will be located in `test/casperjs/`

## <a name="bug-reports"></a>Bug Reports
When the inevitable happens and you discover a bug in the documentation or the
code, please follow the process below to help us out.

* Search the existing issues to see if the issue has already been filed
* Make sure the issue is a bug and not simply a preference
* If you've found a new issue, please then file it

From that point, if you're interest in contributing some code, ask in the issue
if we're willing to accept a failing test case, and/or a fix. If we are, then
follow the steps for contributing and we can go from there!

## <a name="feature-requests"></a>Feature Requests
With a module like Cornerstone, every new feature request should be scrutinized
to make sure we're not going to experience feature bloat. Every new feature should
fit the Vision for the project. If you've got an idea for a new feature and you
feel it fits the vision, file an issue and we can discuss it.

Make sure any feature request you make fits the
[INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic) mnemonic.

## <a name="pull-requests"></a>Pull Requests
A well written pull request is a huge piece of the success of any open source project.
Please make sure to take the time to think out the request and document/comment well.
A good pull request should be the smallest successful feature, akin to the
[INVEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic) mnemonic used in scrum.

Make sure if you're not a project member and just getting started that you have a
related issue for your Pull Request and that a project owner approves the work
before putting the effort in to make the change. Most of the time as long as you're
following the project vision, we'll welcome additions, but it's better to be save
than sorry.

Also, make sure your pull request is built with a compilation of great
[commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

The [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) project has
awesome instructions for Pull Requests, I've added a copy here.

Adhering to the following this process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/application-blueprint
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd application-blueprint
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/web-masons/application-blueprint
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and
   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `phpunit` and `casper`
   tests as relevant to make sure all tests pass after you've made changes.

5. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

9. If you are asked to amend your changes before they can be merged in, please
   use `git commit --amend` (or rebasing for multi-commit Pull Requests) and
   force push to your remote feature branch. You may also be asked to squash
   commits.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to license your work under the
same license as that used by the project.
